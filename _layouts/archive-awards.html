<h2>Yu, H., Liu, D.*, Zhang, C., Yu, L., Yang, B., Qiao, S., Wang, X.,2023. Research on spatial–temporal characteristics and driving factors of urban development intensity for Pearl River Delta region based on Geodetector. Land. 12(9), 1-21.</h2> 
This article is available on this [Link](https://doi.org/10.3390/land12091673). The Pearl River Delta (PRD) is one of the most dynamic economic regions in the Asia-Pacific region. At present, it still faces many problems, such as the over-exploitation of urban land and unbalanced development. Through the study of the spatial–temporal characteristics of the development intensity of the PRD region and its driving factors, the key points and difficulties of urban development can be intuitively found. In previous studies, geodetector was widely used to determine the impact of driving factors. This paper uses several different research methods, including the Moran index, the semi-variability index, hot and cold spots, etc., based on the land use data of the PRD region in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 to analyze the spatial–temporal characteristics of the development intensity. Combined with the socio-economic data of the statistical yearbook, factor detection and interaction detection of the 10 driving factors of development intensity are carried out based on geodetector, and reasonable optimization suggestions are put forward for the current situation of the region. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The overall development intensity of the PRD region shows an upward trend, showing a “core periphery” spatial pattern of high center and low periphery centered around the Pearl River estuary. (2) The spatial distribution of cold and hot spots shows agglomeration, mainly in the form of high aggregation and low aggregation. (3) The driving factors for the development intensity for the PRD region in the past 30 years mainly include population agglomeration level, industrial structure level, economic strength level, terrain slope, etc. Among them, any two factors have a stronger interaction than a single factor, and all are enhanced by two factors. The dominant factors of interaction in different periods are different.

<h2>Yu, H., Yang, Y., Zhao J., Zhang, C.*, Yu, L.**, 2024. Dynamic urban morphology mapping in Chinese cities: A local climate zone approach. Scientific Data. (Under review)</h2> 
Urban expansion and renewal have been significantly reshaping the form of urban areas and natural landscapes, leading to complex urban morphologies. Traditionally, urban regions are represented as impervious surfaces in land cover mapping; however, this single category proves inadequate for characterizing the diverse morphologies of urban landscapes. In 2012, the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification was proposed to address this issue and has since been widely adopted in urban climate studies globally. Despite its prevalence, literature on dynamic mapping of urban morphology remains sparse, making it difficult to delve into the study of urban renewal year by year. In this study, we employed a time-series mapping framework for urban morphology, producing dynamic mappings of urban morphology with a spatial resolution of 100 meters spanning from 2000 to 2022 in major Chinese cities, based on the LCZ scheme. The results demonstrate strong inter-year consistency, and the accuracy of urban morphology change mapping is overall higher than 70%. Additionally, our results exhibit good alignment with other LCZ mapping datasets, more suitable for the current development situation in China, and effectively discriminate between building heights and densities across different LCZ types. This dataset holds significant potential for enhancing urban morphology monitoring and advancing urban climate research.

<h2>Yu, H., Zhang, C.*, Yu, L.**, 2024. Exploration of improvement schemes for simulating LST in Beijing, China over multiple years based on LCZ. Urban Climate. (Under review)</h2> 
In response to the intensification of the urban heat island (UHI) effect caused by the rapid development of global cities in recent years, this study coupled the Urban Canopy Model (UCM) of the Weather Forecast and Research (WRF) model with the Local Climate Zone (LCZ), and developed various different schemes to simulate the land surface temperatures (LST) of Beijing in 2014, 2017, and 2020, to explore the impact of different levels of urban development on the improvement of LST simulation by LCZ, revealing the evolution of the heat island effect. By comparing the observation data from meteorological stations with the default underlying surface, it can be concluded that the improvement effect of LCZ on simulation increases with the growth of years under clear weather conditions, and modifying the building parameters within LCZ offers a more pragmatic approach compared to alterations in the physical parameters. In addition, for the enhancement of the UHI in recent years, LCZ can provide more precise division on both spatial and temporal dimensions, effectively capturing the distribution and changes of urban thermal environment.

<h2>Yu, H., Yang, Y., Yu, L. *, Zhang, C.**, 2024. Impacts of rooftop photovoltaics on urban heat island intensification across different provinces and urban morphologies in China based on LCZ. Urban Climate. (Under review)</h2> 
The rapid and uneven urbanization has exacerbated the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon, posing new challenges to sustainable development goals. The deployment of rooftop photovoltaics (RPVs) is increasingly popular as a significant means to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. However, when considering the realistic heat exchange processes, RPVs often have the effect of intensifying the UHI effect. Quantifying the impact of RPVs on UHI intensification in different provinces and urban morphologies is crucial for mitigating urban thermal environments. This study examines the built-up areas of over 100 km² in various provinces (including municipalities) of China, employing the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) theory and multi-source satellite remote sensing data to calculate the UHI before and after the installation of RPVs from 2015 to 2020, exploring the differences across provinces and urban morphologies, arriving at the following key conclusions: The central-southern and southeastern regions of China saw significant increases in RPV areas, predominantly in large low-rise buildings (LCZ8); In over 80% of the provinces, the net increase in building UHI after RPV installation was positive, with heavy industry areas (LCZ10) being the primary contributors to the enhanced warming effect of RPVs; The more intense the UHI in a region and its building types, the more pronounced the effect of RPVs on exacerbating the heat island phenomenon. Our study will provide theoretical guidance for the rational deployment of RPVs across different provinces and architectural morphologies and offers decision-making support for alleviating urban thermal environments.

Rapid urbanization exacerbates the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, posing challenges to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals amidst global warming. Attributing UHI impacts to urban morphology is increasingly crucial, yet few studies incorporate Local Climate Zone (LCZ) in this context, especially when combined with the interpretability of machine learning in diverse cities and building structures, leading to unclear rule and conclusion among them. This study integrates various dimensional indicators based on multi-source remote sensing data with Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) and employs an integrated machine learning model to predict UHI in Beijing and Tianjin, generalizing the model to Shijiazhuang. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method is used to analyze the influence of each feature at global, local, and LCZ scales. Results indicate that eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) achieves the highest accuracy compared to other models, with its accuracy being improved by 10% or more; Compared with general land classification, LCZ-based classification has more than doubled the validation accuracy, smoothing sharp contrasts while preserving details. The factors affecting UHI in different cities and architectural form have partial consistency, with population growth and vegetation reduction being identified as major factors contributing to significant UHI increases. Our findings provide scientific references for understanding UHI drivers across multiple scales and regions and optimizing urban morphology to mitigate urban thermal environments.
